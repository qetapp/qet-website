      <h1 title="qet">qet</h1>
<p><code>qet</code> is a command-line tool for Linux that acts as a meta package manager. It provides a unified interface to manage packages from different sources, such as system package managers (apt, dnf, pacman), language-specific managers (pip, npm), and other distribution formats (AppImage, Snap, Flatpak).</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why use qet?</h2>
<p><code>qet</code> simplifies managing software on your Linux system in several ways.</p>
<p>It offers a <strong>Unified Interface</strong>, allowing you to use a single, consistent command (<code>qet add</code>, <code>qet remove</code>) for all your applications, regardless of their source.</p>
<p>You retain <strong>Total Control</strong>, deciding which installation method to use for each application, whether you prefer <code>apt</code> for system tools or <code>npm</code> for development utilities.</p>
<p><strong>Effortless Management</strong> means you no longer need to remember how a specific tool was installed; <code>qet</code> tracks everything, enabling updates or removals with simple commands.</p>
<p>With <strong>Easy Auditing</strong>, the central manifest provides a clear overview of every <code>qet</code>-installed application and its source.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>qet</code> facilitates <strong>Reproducible Environments</strong> by allowing you to define your entire software setup in a <code>Qetfile</code>, making it easy to replicate your environment on any new machine.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What qet is not</h2>
<p>It is important to understand what <code>qet</code> is not.</p>
<p><strong><code>qet</code> is not a package manager</strong> itself; it lacks its own package repository, build system, or distribution infrastructure. Instead, it functions as a meta-manager, sitting atop other package managers.</p>
<p>Consequently, <strong><code>qet</code> does not replace your system's package manager</strong>; you will still need <code>apt</code>, <code>dnf</code>, <code>pacman</code>, or similar tools installed and operational, as <code>qet</code> merely provides a unified interface to them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <strong><code>qet</code> does not resolve dependencies across different managers</strong>. For instance, if you install a package with <code>npm</code>, <code>qet</code> will not use <code>apt</code> to install its system-level dependencies.</p>
